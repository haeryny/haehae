title: Night at the Museum
---

Night at the museum was very fun and I had a great time there. I saw many projects including Rebecca's project which was a website based on school clubs at our school. She accessed the database and was able to show all the clubs in our school currently along with the type, the teacher, and the room the meetings were in. You could also add reviews on her website.

I also saw Advay's project and their dating website.

Another place I went was to the AP Art room where I saw a lot of amazing art and photography!

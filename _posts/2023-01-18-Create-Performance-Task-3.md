| Data Abstraction             |      0        |        0            |It does not show the code in an efficient manner and no code is shown to illustrate data being used from the list. This is a good reminder of what not to do.|
| Managing Complexity          |      0        |        0            |I agree with Collegeboard that the response does not explain how the specific code cannot be written without a list.|
| Procedural Abstraction       |      0        |        0            |This did not meet any of the categories and is reminder to make my lists with very specific examples. |
| Algorithm Implementation     |      0        |        0            |This also did not meet any of the requirements and is a good example of what not to do. |
| Testing                      |      0        |        0            |It is rare for a project to get a point off in this category and is a good reminder of what not to do.|

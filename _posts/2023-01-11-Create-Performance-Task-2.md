| Program Purpose and Function |      0        |        0            |I agree with collegeboard on this as the student incorrectly identifies the input and output, and descrived the functionality as the purpose. Thier given purpose was incorrect.|
| Data Abstraction             |     1         |        0            |I gave a 1 because they did have images of lists and identified a name, however, the name did not correleate to the images provided.|
| Managing Complexity          |      0        |          0          |Both collegeboard and I gave a 0 for this section and that's because the images did not show a list being used, and the code was not complex and the sudent did not explain how the list manages complexity|
| Procedural Abstraction       |      0        |         0           |I agree with collegeboard because the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality|
| Algorithm Implementation     |      0        |          0          |I gave it a 0 because the description of the program was brief and doesnâ€™t allow for someone to recreate it |
|Testing                       |      1        |           1         |I agree with collegeboard because hte testing met all the requirements.|

| Program Purpose and Function |      1        |        0            |I gave this a 1 in contrary to collegeboard because the student described the function of the program but not its purpose.|
| Data Abstraction             |     1         |        1            |All the requirments were met.|
| Managing Complexity          |      1        |          1          |All the requirments were met.|
| Procedural Abstraction       |      1        |         1           |All the requirments were met.|
| Algorithm Implementation     |      1        |          1          |All the requirments were met.|

| Program Purpose and Function |      1        |        1            |Good example of how to get a point.|
| Data Abstraction             |     0         |        0            |I agree with collegeboard because data stored in the list is not being used in the second image.|
| Managing Complexity          |      0        |          0          |I gave this person also a 0 because the list is not used to manage complexity|
| Procedural Abstraction       |      1        |         1           |All the requirements were met.|
| Algorithm Implementation     |      1        |          1          |All the requirements were met.
|Testing                       |      0        |           0         |This is because the response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure.|

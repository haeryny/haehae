<p>Procedures can be reffered to as method or function depending on the programing language.</p>
<ul>
<li>A procedrure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure.</li>
<li>Parameters are input values of a procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arguements specifcy the values of the parameters when a procedure is called.</p>
<p>If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statments.</p>
<p>If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedures are that a catch-all term for codes used to identify what was done to or given to a patient</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a set of statements in a procedure the statement will go thought the top of the procedure to the bottom in order.</p>

<li>Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose</li>
<li>Parameter: are input values of a procedur</li>
<li>There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements</li>
<li>Modularity: the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Creating-a-Procedure">Creating a Procedure<a class="anchor-link" href="#Creating-a-Procedure"> </a></h4><ol>
<li>When you are picking a name for the procedure it must be descriptive</li>
<li>See if you need any parameters for this procedure (what data do you need to accomplish my goal? What king of information am I going to need?)</li>
<li>2 of the parameters in the example below could be the quizGrade and currentPoints (need this data)</li>
</ol>
<p>One common type of abstraction is procedrual abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. The subdivision of a computer program into sepearate subprogrames is called modularity.</p>

<li>to make a procedure serve a purpose it should be able to have multiple functions</li>
<li>Also to keep a procedure maximizing capability it should be simple and reduced to get the final result</li>

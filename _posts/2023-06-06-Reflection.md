## Skills you have Obtained
- Computational Thinking: I learned about computational thinking, which involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and formulating algorithmic solutions and I learn to approach problems analytically, identify patterns and relationships, and use abstraction to simplify and generalize solutions.
- Programming and Coding: The course provides students with hands-on experience in programming and coding. I learned to write code in a variety of programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. Through programming exercises and projects, I gained proficiency in problem-solving, logical reasoning, and debugging.
- Data Analysis: I learned how to collect, analyze, and interpret data using computational tools and techniques while explore data representation, visualization, and statistical analysis, gaining the ability to draw meaningful insights and make informed decisions.
- Collaboration and Communication: I learned collaborative skills by working together on projects and engage in group discussions. I learn to communicate their ideas effectively, present their work, and provide constructive feedback to their peers. These skills are essential in today's interconnected world, where teamwork and effective communication are highly valued.

## Highs and Lows from year
Some highs and lows from the year was when my group in first trimester had some communication issues, causing a lot of arguements and a negative atmosphere in our group. However, we eventually got through this problem and was able to go back on track with our project. We also had technical difficulties as one person would touch something they weren't supposed, causing someone else to redo their whole part, but we soon learned as a group to report everything we do together so we know what to do and not to do. A high was when we are able to successfully deploy our project completely for the first time and the backend successfully connected with the frontend. Overall, I enjoyed APCSP a lot this year.

## Future Plans with CompSci
I'm still thinking if I should take APCSA because my desired major is Mechanical Engineering and I believe that APCSA is an important AP to take. 

## Future Plans in Education/Career
I want to major in Mechinacal Engineering or something in engineering in the future.

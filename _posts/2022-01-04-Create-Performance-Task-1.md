| Program Purpose and Function |      0        |        0            |It does not fit the purpose of the task and does something else entirely, so they should be more specifc in the purpose.|
| Data Abstraction             |     1         |        1            |I agree with collegeboard with what they say as they met all the requirements.|
| Managing Complexity          |      0        |          0          |The written response is not specifc at all and does not give any insight into the project, therefore, I agree with collegeboard.|
| Procedural Abstraction       |      1        |         1           |I completely agree with collegeboard because they dit meet the requirements because the code was inserted correctly.|
| Algorithm Implementation     |      1        |          1          |I agree with collegeboard that they met all the requirements and they chose specific algorithms with specific variables.|

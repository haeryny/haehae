<p>She believes that in her life it is important to live with compassion. She graduated as a finance major but then switched her career to high-tech. She started at Qualcomm but switched to a more biotech company: Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HP Inc: Create technology that makes life better for everyone, everywhere.</li>
  <li>Qualcomm: Inventing the tech the world loves</li>
  <li>Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are all similar in the way where they want to help the world and the community around them.</p>

<p>She prefers high-tech because they all want to improve the world and does not value money and likes how her current company makes a positive impact on the world.</p>

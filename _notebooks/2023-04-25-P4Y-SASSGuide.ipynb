    "### In your own words, explain what SASS does:\n",
    "- SASS is an extension of CSS which can be used to create and style parts of your website. It helps improve the complexity of your page by putting all your styles into specific styles where you are able to style your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some benefits to SASS?: \n",
    "- SASS has variables that we can not use in CSS. They also have builtin features and reduces complexity in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe/Explain one of the more \"advanced\" SASS properties below in detail:\n",
    "- The variable property that is part of the \"advanced\" SASS properties help with the overall complexity with your program. You can create variables with the dollar signs and you are able to reduce the complexities. They are easy to communicate with and can be used easily. These variables help with all the code as you are able to reference it in different parts of your SASS and you do not have to write the color over and over again.\n",

    "### How does the number guesser game work?\n",
    "- The number guesser game chooses a number between one through hundred and based on the user's input, the program will ouput one out of three options. The program will say either the number is too high, too low, or is correct. They track how many inputs the user made before they guessed the correct number. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing?\n",
    "- SASS changed the color scheme and the font. It would give the user a more satisfactory exeperience as it is easier to navigate and aesthetically pleasing to look at. The colors are bright and helps increase the user's mood and be more engaging to the program, making the overall game better than it was before."

    <td>0.9/1 on 3.12/13 because 3.12.03 #1.0 does not show understanding (did not divide total yards by amount of games) other than that very detailed notes, and completed all hacks for the assignment. So I fixed that problem and I also reflected on how I could get that right next time. 0.88/1 on 3.9-3.11 because I missed a few explanations but I added more afterwords. I got a 1/1 on the 3.14-15 Hacks because I did all the work and I did hte extra credit.</td>

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Notes . 3.17.1 . A problem is a description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm. An instance of a problem includes a specific input. One example of this type of problem is a sorting problem. | A decision problem is a problem with a binary answer (yes or no). An optimization problem is a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem. | An algorithm&#39;s efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning. | . It is important to know which algorithm is the most efficient and if the algorithm can work for that specific situation. . 3.17.2 . An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations. . There are four different types of algorithms. . 1 step: The first step consists of an integer being multiplied by a variable &#39;n&#39;. An example of this could be 5 * n. Linear | . | 2 step: A two-step algorithm consists of an integer to the power of the variable &#39;n&#39;. Exponential | . | 3 step: A three-step algorithm is an algorithm where there is a variable multiplied by an integer, all to the power of 2. Square | . | 4 step: A four-step algorithm is a variable factorial. For instance, 5! = 5 4 3 2 1 = 120. Factorial | . | . When an algorithm is linear or square, it runs in a reasonable amount of time. However, if the algorithm is exponential or factorial, they are considered to be run in an unreasonable amount of time. A &quot;reasonable amount of time&quot; is when the algorithm increases by smaller values instead of jumping from a lower value to a much higher value. . Run Times . We can categorize the run time of an algorithm according to how the number of steps increases as the input size increases. Does it always take the same amount of time? That&#39;s a constant increase, a very fast run time. Does it always require looking at every possible permutation of the input? That&#39;s an exponential increase, a very slow run time. Most run times are somewhere between. . Constant Time . When an algorithm runs in constant time, it means that it always takes a fixed number of steps, no matter how large the input size increases. . Linear Time . When an algorithm grows in linear time, its number of steps increases in direct proportion to the input size. . Quadratic Time . When an algorithm grows in quadratic time, its steps increase in proportion to the input size squared. Several list sorting algorithms run in quadratic time, like selection sort. That algorithm starts from the front of the list, then keeps finding the next smallest value in the list and swapping it with the current value. . Exponential Time . When an algorithm grows in superpolynomial time, its number of steps increases faster than a polynomial function of the input size. An algorithm often requires superpolynomial time when it must look at every permutation of values. . Polynomial time describes any run time that does not increase faster than n^k which includes Constant time, Quadratic time, and other higher degree polynomials. Superpolynomial time describes any run time that does increase faster than n^k which includes Exponential time and factorial time. So polynomial is considered reasonable. . 3.18 . What is a decidable problem? . These are problems for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs. . What is an undecidable problem? . These are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. Undecidable problems may have some instances of algorithmic solutions, but there are no algorithmic solutions that can solve all instances of the problem. . Vocabulary . Undecidable problem:problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | Decidable problem:problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . Hacks . Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Answer: A decidable problem is a problem for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs. An example is if checking if a specific number is odd or even. . num = 7 if num % 2 == 1: print(&quot;is odd&quot;) else: print(&quot;is even&quot;) . is odd . An undecidable problem is a problem for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. An example is trying to find what the weather is going to be in a million years, no one can know because no one has traveled a million years. . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . Answer: It would be C because a 3 step algorithm is an algorithm where there is a variable multiplied by an integer, all to the power of 2. and C is (3 x 8)^2 so n = 8 and it squared so it is 3 step. . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a more efficient way . Answer: When there were two else&#39;s I just made one shorter and made it more efficient. I tried to use the recursion method but that did not work. I researched more about the recursion method and I realized that it is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. . function peak_finder(array) let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a more efficient way . Answer: You can just use the sort function instead of doing all the code to do it from scratch. . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] data.sort() print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a more efficient way . Answer: You can just use the permutations function instead of doing all the code from scratch. . from itertools import permutations comb = permutations([1, 2, 3], 3) for i in comb: print(i) . (1, 2, 3) (1, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3) (2, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2) (3, 2, 1) .",

Software libraries contain procedures used in creating novel programs. | Existing code segments can be derived from internal or external sources: Libraries, Previously written code. | Libraries simplify complex programs. | APIs (application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave and be utilized. | Documentation for APIs/Libraries are necessary to gain proper understanding into how to use them. | . Vocabulary . Term Definition . Documentation | Text that explains the what, how, or why of your code. | . Libraries | A collection of prewritten code or procedures that coders can use to maximize their efficiency | . Application Programming Interface | A type of software through several computers are able to communicate information amongst eachother | . 3.15 . Syntax: . In collegeboard psudo-code RANDOM(a, b) is used to generate a random integer value in the range from a to b. For example if RANDOM(1, 5) is written 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have the same chance to show up. In Python the random library can be imported and the min and max ranges can be set to any integer. . Randint: . A general way to to write this is randint(start, stop) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value. And this allows you to generate a random integer from a set range and this can help you create code for things like a coin-flip, dice roll, and anything else which needs an inclusive range. . Randrange: . In general randrange can be written like randrange(start, stop, step) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value (like the randint function), and step is the incriment the values can be and its default value is 1. If start = 0 and step = 5 all the values that can by outputed are 0 and multiples of 5. And if start = 2 and step = 3 the output would be 2 and a multiple of 3 plus 2. . Reflection . I learned about the random function and what documentation, libraries, and application programming interfaces are. The random function has three other functions that are syntax, randint, randrange and they all have different purposes and are way more efficient than coding it from the beginning with just python. This lesson was very good and I learned a lot! . Hacks . Multiple Choice . B because the random functions chooses between the range of numbers and it also includes the numbers. | A because x is the number that starts, y is the number that stops, z is the step this is because that is how they are formatted. | A because random:random, random:shuffle, and random:randit exist and are functions in the library, but random:item doesn&#39;t exist. | Short Answer . It is more efficient and speeds up the process of being able to look through the library rather than creating code that has be made for a word that already exists. For example, the randint function is where start is the minimum value and stop is the maximum value so I do not have to make a new piece of code to use that function. | | import random names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) #The function asks for names to input and is the piece of code that makes a list. names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) #This functions helps seperate the names one by one num_items = len(names) #makes the names into a list random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) #randint is the the function where start is the minimum which is 0 and the stop is maximum which is num_items - 1. person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] #This chooses the random name print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) #This is the output. .

Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 | append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. | Elements [in a list] - An item in a list. | Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. | array - Another name for a list, depends on the language | . What are Lists? . Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order | Lists can also be called arrays | Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list. | . Nested Lists . Uses of Nested lists . Placing lists within lists allows you to have arrays of similar data together, and create complexity. . Some uses include: . Creating 2d Arrays | Storing similar, but slightly different categories (sublists) | Create a matrix | . Quiz Score . I got 9/10 right on the quiz, and I got the fourth question wrong. I got it wrong because I thought extend would add something to the list, but extend actually combines two list while append is used to add an element to the end of the list, so that is why I got it wrong. . Excercises . Excercise 1 . Task: Reverse a list utilizing features of lists and iteration | . original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(&quot;List before reverse : &quot;,original_list) reversed_list = [] for value in original_list: reversed_list = [value] + reversed_list print(&quot;List after reverse : &quot;, reversed_list) . List before reverse : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] List after reverse : [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] . Excercise 2 . Task: Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array. Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array | . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] array after sort [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] .",

Boolean binary variable with only two possible values, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; . Relational Operators . There are multiple operators which are used to evaluate 2 variables. In pseudocode the relational operators are =, &gt;, &lt;, ≠, ≥, and ≤. Other languages use different formats to represent these operators. For example, Python uses != instead of ≠. These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement. . Logical Operators . Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators: &amp;&amp;(and), | |(or), |(not). . Operators and booleans can be very useful, allowing a program to create an algorithm based on user inputs items stored in list. For example, operators can be used to perform multiple operations on lists. . Unit 3 Section 6 . Learning Objectives . Write conditional statements | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Vocab . Algorithm: Finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Conditional statements allow the code to act based on multiple conditions, such as user input or stored data. | We can use conditionals in algorithms in order to receive different outputs from a set of code, and help achieve the general purpose of the algorithm. | . Categories . Two broad types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements . if statement: will go through certain statements if the if expression is true | if-else statement: will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false | . Flow Charts . We can use flowcharts to help organize the process of conditional statements. | This allows us to diagram the work and have an image of what the process will look like | . A flowchart . We can use this to write pseudocode. . S &lt;-- 12 IF (S MOD 2 = 0) { DISPLAY (S) } ELSE { DISPLAY (&quot;This number is not even.&quot;) } .

Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. | Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. | Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings. | Some values are better suited to representation using one type of datum rather than another. | . What is a variable? . An abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | . An example naming variables . You want to store the highest score you scored in a game. So, you want to call this variable highScore | You want to store a name, so you can call the variable firstName | It is also possible to store true or false in a variable. For example, the variable could be called isSunny, where true and false are stored in the variable. | phoneNumber could be a variable that stores phone numbers. | These examples are short and convenient as opposed to a long description | However, they give insight to the basic goal of the variable. | Spaces also cause a problem because it is not allowed | Dashes and numbers are also less ideal. | . Data Type examples . highScore --&gt; an integer probably doing addition or subtraction, save it as an integer or numbers. | . | firstName --&gt; text(or string) since a name is text, it should be saved as a string | . | isSunny --&gt; boolean only gives two options: true or false within variable | . | phoneNumber --&gt; text(string) no math involved just a string of numbers | . | . Practice . Question: What would be the best variable name and data type to store a user&#39;s age in a program? . Answer: name: age data type: integer | . Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store the number of students in your class? . A: name: numStudents data type: integer to add and subtract | . Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store the title of a movie? . A: name: movieTitle data type: text(or string) | . Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store if someone&#39;s pet is a dog. . A: name: isDog data type: boolean | . 3.1.2 Notes . What will you learn? . You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment. . Essential Knowledge . The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented to a variable. | The exam reference sheet uses the &quot;⟵&quot; to use for assignment. For example, Text: a ⟵ expression Then the code would display a block text of &quot;a ⟵ expression&quot;. The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. | The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example, . a ⟵ 1 | a ⟵ b | a ⟵ 2 . display(b) . | . | . The code will display 1. . Storing Values . When storing values, you assign them to a variable. . Examples: . highScore ⟵ 100 | The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100. | . firstName ⟵ &quot;Ashley&quot; | The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is &quot;Ashley.&quot; We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment. | . isRaining ⟵ true | The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it&#39;s been assigned to store the value true. | . phoneNumber ⟵ &quot;555-0101&quot; | The phoneNumber variable and the number we are storing is &quot;555-0101&quot; The number is written within text because we are not planning to do math with this number. | . Additional Vocabulary . Elements: individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. And elements are referenced by an index. . Index: referencing elements in a list or string using natural numbers . 3.2.2 Notes . Lists . Lists allow for data abstraction . Variables like strings, numbers, characters, and more can be bundled together | It could be empty from the start and you can add more variables as needed | If you set one list equal to another list, or transfer data from one list to another, the data will be completely replaced. | You can also append data from one list to another, keeping the old data and adding the new data. | . Key Vocabulary . list: a sequence of several variables grouped together | variable: a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used | data types: a set of values and operations on those values | abstract data types: a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client | client: a program that uses a data type | objects: a structure that can take on a data-type value | Applications programming interface (API): which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type | . Big Ideas . Lists can store any types of elements. | In all lists operations, if a list index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the list, an error message is made and the program will terminate. | Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation. | 3.1.1 Hacks . Question 1: . The answer is 1 because it is counting a number that is changing so it is integer. | . Question 2: . The answer is 3 because it is a true or false question. | . Question 3: . The answer is 1 because it is a number that is not changing. | . Question 4: . The answer is 2 because it is too long. | . Question 5: . The answer is 1 because it is true or false. | . Question 6: . The answer is 4 because it is true statements. | . Practice Questions I made: . To check if the weather is good or not, what should it be? It is weatherGood and boolean | To record the highest test score, what should it be? It is highTestScore and string | To record the color of the phone, what should it be? It is phoneColor and string | 3.1.2 Hacks . I got the last question wrong, and that&#39;s because I forgot which order it went and that it does not repeat at all. I now know that the correct answer is because the variables have values thanks to the previous five statements. In the sixth sentence, b is given the value of x + b, which is 40. The seventh sentence gives a the value of x + 1, or 21. The value of c + d / 2 is assigned to d in the ninth sentence. Division takes priority over addition in the order of operations. The number 50 is given to d since c is 30 and d / 2 is 20. The values of a, b, c, and d are shown in the final four assertions. . Practice Questions I made: .

A bit can have only two states, on or off, which are commonly represented as ones and zeros. In our binary markdown we used to change the number of bits. . | bytes: A group of eight bits put together is known as a byte. A byte consists of 256 different combinations if you include the number 00000000 — all the binary numbers between 00000000 and 11111111. . | hexadecimal/nibbles: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. For example, when we use Javascript to change the color of the background on our blogs, we use hexadecimals like #eb4034, which would give us a red color. . | RGB- Hexadecimal is basically a short code for RGB color, they are simply different ways of communicating the same thing – a red, green, and blue color value. For example, (235, 64, 52) is the RGB for RED. Here’s an example of how it is implemented in our fastpages: a { color: rgb(255,255, 255) !important; } . | boolean- value that is either true or false . | ASCII- is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. . | Unicode- is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world’s writing systems. . | Data Compression- is the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size. . | Lossy- in which unnecessary information is discarded. . | Lossless- is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. . | .

Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. . | data types- integer, string, float, boolean, lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc. . | lists- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. . | dictionaries- A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. . | . A plus sign indicates addition: a + b . A subtraction sign indicates subtraction: a - b . An asterisk/star indicates multiplication: a * b . A slash indicates division: a / b . MOD represent the Modulus operator. Returns the value after division: a MOD b . algorithms- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. . | sequence- a section of code is run only if a condition is met. (ex: if statements) . | selection- repeating steps or instructions over and over again (ex: loops) . | iteration- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given . | strings- a sequence of characters . | concatenation- combines two or more strings into one . | length- len function finds the number of characters in a string . | substring- a part of a existing string . | upper- upper() method returns the uppercase string from the given string. It converts all lowercase characters to uppercase. . | lower- lower() method returns the lowercase string from the given string. It converts all uppercase characters to lowercase. . | comparison operators- Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. . | Truth tables- A truth table is a way of summarizing and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. . | if statement- will go through certain statements if the if expression is true . | if-else- will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false . | elif- elif is short for “else if” and is used when the first if statement isn’t true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks. . | nested selection statements- Nested selection structures are used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task. Nesting is a programming activity, in which one program block is placed inside other program block of the same operation type. Nesting processes are mostly used implemented in the selection control structures. . | For Loop: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. . | While Loop: the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop will execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. . | return values: The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function’s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. . | class- A class creates a new local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions. Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword. . | parameters- Parameters are the variables that appear between the brackets in the “def” line of a Python function definition. . | procedural abstraction- One good use of a procedure is to eliminate duplicate code. In addition to improving the readability of the app, the use of a procedure will make it easier to modify that chunk of code because it only occurs once in the program.

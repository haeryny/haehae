            "content": "3.1.1 Notes . Variables and Assignments . Essential Knowledge: . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. | Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. | Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings. | Some values are better suited to representation using one type of datum rather than another. | . What is a variable? . An abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | . An example naming variables . You want to store the highest score you scored in a game. So, you want to call this variable highScore | You want to store a name, so you can call the variable firstName | It is also possible to store true or false in a variable. For example, the variable could be called isSunny, where true and false are stored in the variable. | phoneNumber could be a variable that stores phone numbers. | These examples are short and convenient as opposed to a long description | However, they give insight to the basic goal of the variable. | Spaces also cause a problem because it is not allowed | Dashes and numbers are also less ideal. | . Data Type examples . highScore --&gt; an integer probably doing addition or subtraction, save it as an integer or numbers. | . | firstName --&gt; text(or string) since a name is text, it should be saved as a string | . | isSunny --&gt; boolean only gives two options: true or false within variable | . | phoneNumber --&gt; text(string) no math involved just a string of numbers | . | . Practice . Question: What would be the best variable name and data type to store a user&#39;s age in a program? . Answer: name: age data type: integer | . Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store the number of students in your class? . A: name: numStudents data type: integer to add and subtract | . Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store the title of a movie? . A: name: movieTitle data type: text(or string) | . Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store if someone&#39;s pet is a dog. . A: name: isDog data type: boolean | . 3.1.2 Notes . What will you learn? . You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment. . Essential Knowledge . The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented to a variable. | The exam reference sheet uses the &quot;⟵&quot; to use for assignment. For example, Text: a ⟵ expression Then the code would display a block text of &quot;a ⟵ expression&quot;. The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. | The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example, . a ⟵ 1 | a ⟵ b | a ⟵ 2 . display(b) . | . | . The code will display 1. . Storing Values . When storing values, you assign them to a variable. . Examples: . highScore ⟵ 100 | The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100. | . firstName ⟵ &quot;Ashley&quot; | The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is &quot;Ashley.&quot; We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment. | . isRaining ⟵ true | The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it&#39;s been assigned to store the value true. | . phoneNumber ⟵ &quot;555-0101&quot; | The phoneNumber variable and the number we are storing is &quot;555-0101&quot; The number is written within text because we are not planning to do math with this number. | . Additional Vocabulary . Elements: individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. And elements are referenced by an index. . Index: referencing elements in a list or string using natural numbers . 3.2.2 Notes . Lists . Lists allow for data abstraction . Variables like strings, numbers, characters, and more can be bundled together | It could be empty from the start and you can add more variables as needed | If you set one list equal to another list, or transfer data from one list to another, the data will be completely replaced. | You can also append data from one list to another, keeping the old data and adding the new data. | . Key Vocabulary . list: a sequence of several variables grouped together | variable: a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used | data types: a set of values and operations on those values | abstract data types: a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client | client: a program that uses a data type | objects: a structure that can take on a data-type value | Applications programming interface (API): which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type | . Big Ideas . Lists can store any types of elements. | In all lists operations, if a list index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the list, an error message is made and the program will terminate. | Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation. | 3.1.1 Hacks . Question 1: . The answer is 1 because it is counting a number that is changing so it is integer. | . Question 2: . The answer is 3 because it is a true or false question. | . Question 3: . The answer is 1 because it is a number that is not changing. | . Question 4: . The answer is 2 because it is too long. | . Question 5: . The answer is 1 because it is true or false. | . Question 6: . The answer is 4 because it is true statements. | . Practice Questions I made: . To check if the weather is good or not, what should it be? It is weatherGood and boolean | To record the highest test score, what should it be? It is highTestScore and string | To record the color of the phone, what should it be? It is phoneColor and string | 3.1.2 Hacks . I got the last question wrong, and that&#39;s because I forgot which order it went and that it does not repeat at all. I now know that the correct answer is because the variables have values thanks to the previous five statements. In the sixth sentence, b is given the value of x + b, which is 40. The seventh sentence gives a the value of x + 1, or 21. The value of c + d / 2 is assigned to d in the ninth sentence. Division takes priority over addition in the order of operations. The number 50 is given to d since c is 30 and d / 2 is 20. The values of a, b, c, and d are shown in the final four assertions. . Practice Questions I made: . Question 1 | . num1 &lt;- 8 . num2 &lt;- 3 . num2 &lt;- num1 + num2 . DISPLAY(num2) = 11 . Question 2 | . A &lt;- 4 . B &lt;- 5 . X &lt;- A . DISPLAY(B) = 5 . Question 3 | . Y &lt;- 1 . Z &lt;- 2 . W &lt;- Y . DISPLAY(W) = 1 . Question 4 | . T &lt;- 45 . D &lt;- 12 . X &lt;- T + D . DISPLAY(X) = 57 . Question 5 | . testA &lt;- 40 . testB &lt;- 50 . testC &lt;- 60 . testAll &lt;- testA + testB + testC . DISPLAY(testAll) = 150 . Question 6 | . labD &lt;- 1 . labE &lt;- 2 . labD &lt;- labE . DISPLAY(B) = 1 . 3.2.2 Hacks . Question 1: 7 . Question 2: 11 . Question 3: 107 . Question 4: 1100 . Question 5: 101100 . Question 6: 11111110 . Question 7: 4 . Question 8: 1 . Question 9: 3 .

Procedures can be reffered to as method or function depending on the programing language. . A procedrure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. | . Arguements specifcy the values of the parameters when a procedure is called. . If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statments. . If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements . Procedures are that a catch-all term for codes used to identify what was done to or given to a patient | . If you have a set of statements in a procedure the statement will go thought the top of the procedure to the bottom in order. . 3.13 Notes . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose | Parameter: are input values of a procedur | There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements | Modularity: the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | . Creating a Procedure . When you are picking a name for the procedure it must be descriptive | See if you need any parameters for this procedure (what data do you need to accomplish my goal? What king of information am I going to need?) | 2 of the parameters in the example below could be the quizGrade and currentPoints (need this data) | One common type of abstraction is procedrual abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. The subdivision of a computer program into sepearate subprogrames is called modularity. . How do we make our procedure purposeful and consice . to make a procedure serve a purpose it should be able to have multiple functions | Also to keep a procedure maximizing capability it should be simple and reduced to get the final result | . What is important to do while writing procedures . It is important to understand you procudeures procedure does when creating one as it will help you create a impactful procedure . Hacks . 3.12 Part 1 Hacks . Problem 1: This problem involves parameters | . Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed = Total Time/Total Distance​ . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } . Problem 2: Procedures with return values James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) | . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, &quot;!!!&quot;) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . False .

            "content": "Notes 3.8-10 . Section 8 . Understanding What is Iteration | Using for and while loops | . Necessary Vocabulary . Iteration - Repitition of a Process | For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated | While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met | Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. | Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. | increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. | . What is Iteration? . Iterative statements are also called loops, and they repeat themselves over and over until the condition for stopping is met. . In College Board&#39;s Pseudocode, the first is a REPEAT n TIMES loop, where the n represents some number. . The second type of loop is a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop, where the loop will continue to run until a condition is met. . Conceptually, a while loop is very similar to an if conditional, except that a while is continually executed until it&#39;s no longer true and an if is only executed once. . Section 10 . Understanding how to edit lists by adding, inserting, and removing data | Using loops to iterate through lists and abstract data | Determine the results or side effects of iteration statements | Write sorting algorithms using iteration | . Necessary Vocabulary . Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 | append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. | Elements [in a list] - An item in a list. | Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. | array - Another name for a list, depends on the language | . What are Lists? . Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order | Lists can also be called arrays | Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list. | . Nested Lists . Uses of Nested lists . Placing lists within lists allows you to have arrays of similar data together, and create complexity. . Some uses include: . Creating 2d Arrays | Storing similar, but slightly different categories (sublists) | Create a matrix | . Quiz Score . I got 9/10 right on the quiz, and I got the fourth question wrong. I got it wrong because I thought extend would add something to the list, but extend actually combines two list while append is used to add an element to the end of the list, so that is why I got it wrong. . Excercises . Excercise 1 . Task: Reverse a list utilizing features of lists and iteration | . original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(&quot;List before reverse : &quot;,original_list) reversed_list = [] for value in original_list: reversed_list = [value] + reversed_list print(&quot;List after reverse : &quot;, reversed_list) . List before reverse : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] List after reverse : [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] . Excercise 2 . Task: Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array. Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array | . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] array after sort [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] .",

Boolean binary variable with only two possible values, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; . Relational Operators . There are multiple operators which are used to evaluate 2 variables. In pseudocode the relational operators are =, &gt;, &lt;, ≠, ≥, and ≤. Other languages use different formats to represent these operators. For example, Python uses != instead of ≠. These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement. . Logical Operators . Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators: &amp;&amp;(and), | |(or), |(not). . Operators and booleans can be very useful, allowing a program to create an algorithm based on user inputs items stored in list. For example, operators can be used to perform multiple operations on lists. . Unit 3 Section 6 . Learning Objectives . Write conditional statements | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Vocab . Algorithm: Finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Conditional statements allow the code to act based on multiple conditions, such as user input or stored data. | We can use conditionals in algorithms in order to receive different outputs from a set of code, and help achieve the general purpose of the algorithm. | . Categories . Two broad types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements . if statement: will go through certain statements if the if expression is true | if-else statement: will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false | .

Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. | Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. | Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings. | Some values are better suited to representation using one type of datum rather than another. | . What is a variable? . An abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | . An example naming variables . You want to store the highest score you scored in a game. So, you want to call this variable highScore | You want to store a name, so you can call the variable firstName | It is also possible to store true or false in a variable. For example, the variable could be called isSunny, where true and false are stored in the variable. | phoneNumber could be a variable that stores phone numbers. | These examples are short and convenient as opposed to a long description | However, they give insight to the basic goal of the variable. | Spaces also cause a problem because it is not allowed | Dashes and numbers are also less ideal. | . Data Type examples . highScore --&gt; an integer probably doing addition or subtraction, save it as an integer or numbers. | . | firstName --&gt; text(or string) since a name is text, it should be saved as a string | . | isSunny --&gt; boolean only gives two options: true or false within variable | . | phoneNumber --&gt; text(string) no math involved just a string of numbers | . | .

Q: What would be the best variable name and data type to store if someone&#39;s pet is a dog. . A: name: isDog data type: boolean | . 3.1.2 Notes . What will you learn? . You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment. . Essential Knowledge . The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented to a variable. | The exam reference sheet uses the &quot;⟵&quot; to use for assignment. For example, Text: a ⟵ expression Then the code would display a block text of &quot;a ⟵ expression&quot;. The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. | The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example, . a ⟵ 1 | a ⟵ b | a ⟵ 2 . display(b) . | . | . The code will display 1. . Storing Values . When storing values, you assign them to a variable. . Examples: . highScore ⟵ 100 | The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100. | . firstName ⟵ &quot;Ashley&quot; | The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is &quot;Ashley.&quot; We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment. | . isRaining ⟵ true | The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it&#39;s been assigned to store the value true. | . phoneNumber ⟵ &quot;555-0101&quot; | The phoneNumber variable and the number we are storing is &quot;555-0101&quot; The number is written within text because we are not planning to do math with this number. | . Additional Vocabulary . Elements: individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. And elements are referenced by an index. . Index: referencing elements in a list or string using natural numbers . 3.2.2 Notes . Lists . Lists allow for data abstraction . Variables like strings, numbers, characters, and more can be bundled together | It could be empty from the start and you can add more variables as needed | If you set one list equal to another list, or transfer data from one list to another, the data will be completely replaced. | You can also append data from one list to another, keeping the old data and adding the new data. | . Key Vocabulary . list: a sequence of several variables grouped together | variable: a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used | data types: a set of values and operations on those values | abstract data types: a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client | client: a program that uses a data type | objects: a structure that can take on a data-type value | Applications programming interface (API): which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type | . Big Ideas . Lists can store any types of elements. | In all lists operations, if a list index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the list, an error message is made and the program will terminate. | Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation. | 3.1.1 Hacks . Question 1: . The answer is 1 because it is counting a number that is changing so it is integer. | . Question 2: . The answer is 3 because it is a true or false question. | . Question 3: . The answer is 1 because it is a number that is not changing. | . Question 4: . The answer is 2 because it is too long. | . Question 5: . The answer is 1 because it is true or false. | . Question 6: . The answer is 4 because it is true statements. | . Practice Questions I made: . To check if the weather is good or not, what should it be? It is weatherGood and boolean | To record the highest test score, what should it be? It is highTestScore and string | To record the color of the phone, what should it be? It is phoneColor and string | 3.1.2 Hacks . I got the last question wrong, and that&#39;s because I forgot which order it went and that it does not repeat at all. I now know that the correct answer is because the variables have values thanks to the previous five statements. In the sixth sentence, b is given the value of x + b, which is 40. The seventh sentence gives a the value of x + 1, or 21. The value of c + d / 2 is assigned to d in the ninth sentence. Division takes priority over addition in the order of operations. The number 50 is given to d since c is 30 and d / 2 is 20. The values of a, b, c, and d are shown in the final four assertions. . Practice Questions I made: .

          "content": "Unit 2 Binary/Data Terms . bits: the minimum unit of binary information stored in a computer system. A bit can have only two states, on or off, which are commonly represented as ones and zeros. In our binary markdown we used to change the number of bits. . | bytes: A group of eight bits put together is known as a byte. A byte consists of 256 different combinations if you include the number 00000000 — all the binary numbers between 00000000 and 11111111. . | hexadecimal/nibbles: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. For example, when we use Javascript to change the color of the background on our blogs, we use hexadecimals like #eb4034, which would give us a red color. . | RGB- Hexadecimal is basically a short code for RGB color, they are simply different ways of communicating the same thing – a red, green, and blue color value. For example, (235, 64, 52) is the RGB for RED. Here’s an example of how it is implemented in our fastpages: a { color: rgb(255,255, 255) !important; } . | boolean- value that is either true or false . | . Unit 3 Algorithm/Programming Terms . variables- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value. Each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values. Using meaningful variable names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables. Some programming languages provide types to represent data, which are referenced using variables. . | data types- integer, string, float, boolean, lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc. . | lists- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. . | dictionaries- A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. . | . A plus sign indicates addition: a + b . A subtraction sign indicates subtraction: a - b . An asterisk/star indicates multiplication: a * b . A slash indicates division: a / b . MOD represent the Modulus operator. Returns the value after division: a MOD b . algorithms- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. . | sequence- a section of code is run only if a condition is met. (ex: if statements) . | selection- repeating steps or instructions over and over again (ex: loops) . | iteration- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given . | strings- a sequence of characters . | concatenation- combines two or more strings into one . | length- len function finds the number of characters in a string . | substring- a part of a existing string . | upper- upper() method returns the uppercase string from the given string. It converts all lowercase characters to uppercase. . | lower- lower() method returns the lowercase string from the given string. It converts all uppercase characters to lowercase. . | comparison operators- Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. . | Truth tables- A truth table is a way of summarizing and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. . | if statement- will go through certain statements if the if expression is true . | if-else- will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false . | elif- elif is short for “else if” and is used when the first if statement isn’t true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks. . | nested selection statements- Nested selection structures are used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task. Nesting is a programming activity, in which one program block is placed inside other program block of the same operation type. Nesting processes are mostly used implemented in the selection control structures. . | For Loop: repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. . | While Loop: the while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop will execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. . | return values: The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function’s return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit. . | class- A class creates a new local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions. Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword. . | parameters- Parameters are the variables that appear between the brackets in the “def” line of a Python function definition. . | procedural abstraction- One good use of a procedure is to eliminate duplicate code. In addition to improving the readability of the app, the use of a procedure will make it easier to modify that chunk of code because it only occurs once in the program. Use of parameters and complexity. . | .",

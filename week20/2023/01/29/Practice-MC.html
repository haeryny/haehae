<p>I got 38/50</p>

<h2 id="question-21">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-21" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 21:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said C which was “The number 10 is displayed” because I thought that it was not limited, but apparently the correct answer was D which was “Nothing is displayed; the program results in an infinite loop.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-23">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-23" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 23:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said D which was “1 2 3 4 5” which is wrong because it displays multiple numbers and it should only display one number so the correct answer is A which is “5.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-25">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-25" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 25:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said C but its is incorrect because the value of the variable j starts at 1 and increases by 2. If <missing condition=""> is replaced with the expression j = 7, the expression will evaluate to true when j is 7 and the loop will end. The correct answer is A which is j = 6.</missing>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-27">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-27" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 27:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said A but its is incorrect because it is not supposed to say that n = n + 1. The correct answer is D.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-28">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-28" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 28:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said A and D, but it was A and C. D is wrong because after completing the inner Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will be in the center square of the grid facing down. Since this loop is nested inside another Repeat 2 times loop, these commands are executed again. At the end of execution, the robot will be in the same position at which it started. So C and A is correct.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-30">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 30:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said A and C, but it was B and C. A is wrong because it will not draw the circle after (x,y,r). So the correct answer is B and C.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-31">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-31" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 31:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said that the answer was A but that is incorrect because if a is 30 and b is 50, the original code segment would result in final values of a equals 30 and b equals 70.  However, changing line 7 to b equals 20. would result in final values of a equals 30 and b equals 20. So the correct answer is A</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-34">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-34" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 34:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said C which was “The number 10 is displayed” because I thought that it was not limited, but apparently the correct answer was D which was “Nothing is displayed; the program results in an infinite loop.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-36">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-36" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 36:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said D which was “1 2 3 4 5” which is wrong because it displays multiple numbers and it should only display one number so the correct answer is A which is “5.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-40">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-40" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 40:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said C but its is incorrect because the value of the variable j starts at 1 and increases by 2. If the condition is replaced with the expression j = 7, the expression will evaluate to true when j is 7 and the loop will end. The correct answer is A which is j = 6.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-43">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-43" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 43:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said A but its is incorrect because it is not supposed to say that n = n + 1. The correct answer is D.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-48">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-48" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 48:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I said A and D, but it was A and C. D is wrong because after completing the inner Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will be in the center square of the grid facing down. Since this loop is nested inside another Repeat 2 times loop, these commands are executed again. At the end of execution, the robot will be in the same position at which it started. So C and A is correct.</li>
